# Resolver is like [Soulver](https://soulver.app/), but for your terminal
Soulver, the excellent Mac app, describes itself as "a notepad calculator app for Mac". **Resolver** aims to be the notepad calculator for anything with a terminal: Linux, Mac, wherever.

## Using Resolver
Resolver is currently in early development and it has a lot of rough edges. Many of the basics work reasonably well, but if you're inclined to try it out, your expectations should be low.

To run Resolver, build it from source. A recent Rust toolchain is required.

```
$ cargo run
```
