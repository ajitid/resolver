Resolver is the NOTEPAD CALCULATOR for your terminal.

Just type your notes and Resolver will automatically identify and evaluate mathematic expressions it finds in them.

This can be simple arithmetic like: 5, or 100 * (7 / 8), or pi * 2.

You can assign variables and use the result later. If tax_rate = 0.0875 then:

  subtotal = 100.00
  total_taxes = subtotal * tax_rate

The grand total comes to: subtotal + total_taxes.

Units and conversion between them is supported also. So if you need to know (12 tbsp + 1 cup) in tsps, that's no problem.
