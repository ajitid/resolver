Hello, there. Resolver, back at it again.

Here's a highlight of a few of the notable features of the moment:

Resolver supports simple expressions like 10 + 40 and (1 / 3) * 100. We can use as many of these as we like.

Assignments are also supported. For example, if tax = 0.0875, then the total cost of a 100 USD purchase is 100 + (100 * tax).
