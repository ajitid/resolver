Resolver, the notepad calculator, is back at it again.

Here's a highlight of a few of the notable features of the moment:

Resolver is a text editor that supports simple expressions used anywhere you like. Such as 10 + 40 or (1 / 3) * 100. We can use as many of these as we like on a line.

We'll see the result of these calculations displayed in the right column, matched up by color.

Assignments are also supported. For example, if tax = 0.0875, then the total cost of a $100 purchase is $100 + (100 * tax).
